Prototype for a Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition Random Character Generator.

Project Notes/Thoughts: We had roughly a two day time limit to see what we could put together, and this first iteration of the prototype only encompasses Classes, Races, and Skills from the Player's Handbook of 5th Edition. One of the biggest challenges behind this current iteration was dealing with the scope and getting a good idea for how we can split up the Character class into further divisions in the future. 

Future additions should include: Spell-Lists, Saving Throws, Equipment, Additional means of randomizing characters (current stat generation only includes the Standard Array, selected randomly), Subclasses, and all associated Features.

The current intention for the base Character class found here is to further break it apart and create associated lists in further classes. For a proof of concept, we're quite proud of what we were able to put together in such a short time and given the complexity of the game itself in terms of possible choices.
